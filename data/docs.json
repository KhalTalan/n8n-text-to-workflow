Find comprehensive resources to help you master app integrations using different types of nodes to improve your automation workflows.\ncontentType: overview\nhide:\n  - feedback\n  - kapaButton\n---\n\n# Integrations\n\nn8n calls integrations nodes.\n\nNodes are the building blocks of workflows in n8n. They're an entry point for retrieving data, a function to process data, or an exit for sending data. The data process includes filtering, recomposing, and changing data. There can be one or several nodes for your API, service or app. You can connect multiple nodes, which allows you to create complex workflows.\n\n## Built-in nodes\n\nn8n includes a collection of built-in integrations. Refer to [Built-in nodes](/integrations/builtin/node-types.md) for documentation on all n8n's built-in nodes.\n\n## Community nodes\n\nAs well as using the built-in nodes, you can also install community-built nodes. Refer to [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/installation/index.md) for more information.\n\n## Credential-only nodes and custom operations\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/credential-only-intro.md\"\n\nRefer to [Custom operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.\n\n## Generic integrations\n\nIf you need to connect to a service where n8n doesn't have a node, or a credential-only node, you can still use the [HTTP Request](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/index.md) node. Refer to the node page for details on how to set up authentication and create your API call.\n\n## Where to go next\n\n* If you want to create your own node, head over to the [Creating Nodes](/integrations/creating-nodes/overview.md) section.\n* Check out [Community nodes](/integrations/community-nodes/usage.md) to learn about installing and managing community-built nodes.\n* If you'd like to learn more about the different nodes in n8n, their functionalities and example usage, check out n8n's node libraries: [Core nodes](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/index.md), [Actions](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/index.md), and [Triggers](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/index.md).\n* If you'd like to learn how to add the credentials for the different nodes, head over to the [Credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/index.md) section.\n"

You can find the trigger node docs [here](/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtabletrigger.md).\n\nRefer to [Airtable's documentation](https://airtable.com/developers/web/api/introduction) for more information about the service.\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/operation-not-supported.md\"\n\n\n## Node reference\n\n### Get the Record ID\n\nTo fetch data for a particular record, you need the Record ID. There are two ways to get the Record ID.\n\n### Create a Record ID column in Airtable\n\nTo create a `Record ID` column in your table, refer to this [article](https://support.airtable.com/docs/finding-airtable-ids). You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.\n\n### Use the List operation\n\nTo get the Record ID of your record, you can use the **List** operation of the Airtable node. This operation will return the Record ID along with the fields. You can then use this Record ID in your Airtable node.\n\n### Filter records when using the List operation\n\nTo filter records from your Airtable base, use the **Filter By Formula** option. For example, if you want to return all the users that belong to the organization `n8n`, follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n1. Select 'List' from the **Operation** dropdown list.\n2. Enter the base ID and the table name in the **Base ID** and **Table** field, respectively.\n3. Click on **Add Option** and select 'Filter By Formula' from the dropdown list.\n4. Enter the following formula in the **Filter By Formula** field: `{Organization}='n8n'`.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to return all the users that don't belong to the organization `n8n`, use the following formula: `NOT({Organization}='n8n')`.\n\nRefer to the Airtable [documentation](https://support.airtable.com/hc/en-us/articles/203255215-Formula-Field-Reference) to learn more about the formulas.\n\n## Common issues\n\nFor common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common Issues](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.airtable/common-issues.md).\n"

Follow technical documentation to integrate MySQL node into your workflows.\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\npriority: high\n---\n\n# MySQL node\n\nUse the MySQL node to automate work in MySQL, and integrate MySQL with other applications. n8n has built-in support for a wide range of MySQL features, including executing an SQL query, as well as inserting, and updating rows in a database.\n\nOn this page, you'll find a list of operations the MySQL node supports and links to more resources.\n\n/// note | Credentials\nRefer to [MySQL credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/mysql.md) for guidance on setting up authentication. \n///\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/ai-tools.md\"\n\n## Operations\n\n* Delete\n* Execute SQL\n* Insert\n* Insert or Update\n* Select\n* Update\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'mysql') ]]\n\n## Related resources\n\nRefer to [MySQL's Connectors and APIs documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-connectors.html) for more information about the service.\n\nRefer to MySQL's [SELECT statement documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html) for more information on writing SQL queries.\n\n## Use query parameters\n\nWhen creating a query to run on a MySQL database, you can use the **Query Parameters** field in the **Options** section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection.\n\nFor example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data:\n\n```js\n[\n    {\n        \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n        \"name\": \"Alex\",\n        \"age\": 21 \n    },\n    {\n        \"email\": \"jamie@example.com\",\n        \"name\": \"Jamie\",\n        \"age\": 33 \n    }\n]\n```\n\nYou can write a query like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM $1:name WHERE email = $2;\n```\n\nThen in **Query Parameters**, provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn:\n\n```js\n// users is an example table name\nusers, {{ $json.email }} \n```\n\n## Common issues\n\nFor common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to [Common issues](/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.mysql/common-issues.md).\n"

It allows you to make HTTP requests to query data from any app or service with a REST API. You can use the HTTP Request node a regular node or attached to an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md) to use as a [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md){ data-preview }.\n\nWhen using this node, you're creating a REST API call. You need some understanding of basic API terminology and concepts.\n\nThere are two ways to create an HTTP request: configure the [node parameters](#node-parameters) or [import a curl command](#import-curl-command).\n\n/// note | Credentials\nRefer to [HTTP Request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for guidance on setting up authentication. \n///\n\n## Node parameters\n\n### Method\n\nSelect the method to use for the request:\n\n- DELETE\n- GET\n- HEAD\n- OPTIONS\n- PATCH\n- POST\n- PUT\n\n### URL\n\nEnter the endpoint you want to use.\n\n### Authentication\n\nn8n recommends using the **Predefined Credential Type** option when it's available. It offers an easier way to set up and manage credentials, compared to configuring generic credentials.\n\n#### Predefined credentials\n\nCredentials for integrations supported by n8n, including both built-in and community nodes. Use **Predefined Credential Type** for custom operations without extra setup. Refer to [Custom API operations](/integrations/custom-operations.md) for more information.\n\n#### Generic credentials\n\nCredentials for integrations not supported by n8n. You'll need to manually configure the authentication process, including specifying the required API endpoints, necessary parameters, and the authentication method. \n\nYou can select one of the following methods:\n\n* Basic auth\n* Custom auth\n* Digest auth\n* Header auth\n* OAuth1 API\n* OAuth2 API\n* Query auth\n\nRefer to [HTTP request credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/httprequest.md) for more information on setting up each credential type.\n\n### Send Query Parameters\n\nQuery parameters act as filters on HTTP requests.

Options are available to all parameters unless otherwise noted.\n\n### Array Format in Query Parameters\n\n/// note | Option availability\nThis option is only available when you turn on **Send Query Parameters**.\n///\n\nUse this option to control the format for arrays included in query parameters. Choose from these options:\n\n* **No Brackets**: Arrays will format as the name=value for each item in the array, for example: `foo=bar&foo=qux`.\n* **Brackets Only**: The node adds square brackets after each array name, for example: `foo[]=bar&foo[]=qux`.\n* **Brackets with Indices**: The node adds square brackets with an index value after each array name, for example: `foo[0]=bar&foo[1]=qux`.\n\nRefer to your service's API documentation for guidance on which option to use.\n\n### Batching\n\nControl how to batch large numbers of input items:\n\n* **Items per Batch**: Enter the number of input items to include in each batch.\n* **Batch Interval**: Enter the time to wait between each batch of requests in milliseconds. Enter 0 for no batch interval.\n\n### Ignore SSL Issues\n\nBy default, n8n only downloads the response if SSL certificate validation succeeds. If you'd like to download the response even if SSL certificate validation fails, turn this option on.\n\n### Lowercase Headers\n\nChoose whether to lowercase header names (turned on, default) or not (turned off).\n\n### Redirects\n\nChoose whether to follow redirects (turned on by default) or not (turned off). If turned on, enter the maximum number of redirects the request should follow in **Max Redirects**.\n\n### Response\n\nUse this option to set some details about the expected API response, including:\n\n* **Include Response Headers and Status**: By default, the node returns only the body. Turn this option on to return the full response (headers and response status code) as well as the body.\n* **Never Error**: By default, the node returns success only when the response returns with a 2xx code. Turn this option on to return success regardless of the code returned.\n* **Response Format**: Select the format in which the data gets returned. Choose from:\n    * **Autodetect** (default): The node detects and formats the response based on the data returned.\n    * **File**: Select this option to put the response into a file. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.\n    * **JSON**: Select this option to format the response as JSON.\n    * **Text**: Select this option to format the response as plain text. Enter the field name where you want the file returned in **Put Output in Field**.\n\n### Pagination\n\nUse this option to paginate results, useful for handling query results that are too big for the API to return in a single call.\n\n/// note | Inspect the API data first\nSome options for pagination require knowledge of the data returned by the API you're using. Before setting up pagination, either check the API documentation, or do an API call without pagination, to see the data it returns.\n///\n??? Details \"Understand pagination\"\n    Pagination means splitting a large set of data into multiple pages. The amount of data on each page depends on the limit you set.\n  \n    For example, you make an API call to an endpoint called `/users`. The API wants to send back information on 300 users, but this is too much data for the API to send in one response. \n  \n    If the API supports pagination, you can incrementally fetch the data. To do this, you call `/users` with a pagination limit, and a page number or URL to tell the API which page to send. In this example, say you use a limit of 10, and start from page 0. The API sends the first 10 users in its response. You then call the API again, increasing the page number by 1, to get the next 10 results.\n\nConfigure the pagination settings:\n\n* **Pagination Mode**:\n    * **Off**: Turn off pagination.\n    * **Update a Parameter in Each Request**: Use this when you need to dynamically set parameters for each request.\n    * **Response Contains Next URL**: Use this when the API response includes the URL of the next page. Use an expression to set **Next URL**.\n\nFor example setups, refer to [HTTP Request node cookbook | Pagination](/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination.md).\n\nn8n provides built-in variables for working with HTTP node requests and responses when using pagination:\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-variables.md\"\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/http/pagination-api-differences.md\"\n\n### Proxy\n\nUse this option if you need to specify an HTTP proxy.\n\nEnter the **Proxy** the request should use. This takes precedence over global settings defined with the [`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or `ALL_PROXY` environment variables](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/deployment.md).\n\n### Timeout\n\nUse this option to set how long the node should wait for the server to send response headers (and start the response body). The node aborts requests that exceed this value for the initial response.\n\nEnter the **Timeout** time to wait in milliseconds.\n\n## Tool-only options\n\nThe following options are only available when attached to an [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/tools-agent.md) as a [tool](/advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools.md){ data-preview }.\n\n### Optimize Response\n\nWhether to optimize the tool response to reduce the amount of data passed to the LLM. Optimizing the response can reduce costs and can help the LLM ignore unimportant details, often leading to better results.\n\nWhen optimizing responses, you select an expected response type, which determines other options you can configure. The supported response types are:\n\n#### JSON\n\nWhen expecting a **JSON** response, you can configure which parts of the JSON data to use as a response with the following choices:\n\n* **Field Containing Data**: This field identifies a specific part of the JSON object that contains your relevant data. You can leave this blank to use the entire response.\n* **Include Fields**: This is how you choose which fields you want in your response object. There are three choices:\n\t* **All**: Include all fields in the response object.\n\t* **Selected**: Include only the fields specified below.\n\t\t* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to include in the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.\n\t* **Exclude**: Include all fields *except* the fields specified below.\n\t\t* **Fields**: A comma-separated list of fields to exclude from the response. You can use dot notation to specify nested fields. You can drag fields from the Input panel to add them to the field list.\n\n#### HTML\n\nWhen expecting **HTML**, you can identify the part of an HTML document relevant to the LLM and optimize the response with the following options:\n\n* **Selector (CSS)**: A specific element or element type to include in the response HTML. Uses the `body` element by default.\n* **Return Only Content**: Whether to strip HTML tags and attributes from the response, leaving only the actual content. This uses fewer tokens and may be easier for the model to understand.\n\t* **Elements To Omit**: A comma-separated list of CSS selectors to exclude when extracting content.\n* **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.\n\t* **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.\n\n#### Text\n\nWhen expecting a generic **Text** response, you can optimize the results with the following options:\n\n* **Truncate Response**: Whether to limit the response size to save tokens.\n\t* **Max Response Characters**: The maximum number of characters to include in the HTML response. The default value is 1000.\n\n## Import curl command\n\n[curl](https://curl.se/) is a command line tool and library for transferring data with URLs.\n\nYou can use curl to call REST APIs. If the API documentation of the service you want to use provides curl examples, you can copy them out of the documentation and into n8n to configure the HTTP Request node.\n\nImport a curl command:\n\n1. From the HTTP Request node's **Parameters** tab, select **Import cURL**. The **Import cURL command** modal opens.\n2. Paste your curl command into the text box.\n3. Select **Import**. n8n loads the request configuration into the node fields. This overwrites any existing configuration.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'http-request') ]]\n\n## Common issues\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common Issues](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/common-issues.md).\n"

When working with large datasets it becomes more difficult to spot and remove these items.\n\nBy comparing against data from previous executions, the Remove Duplicates node can  delete items seen in earlier executions. It can also ensure that new items have a later date or a higher value than previous values.\n\n/// note | Major changes in 1.64.0\nThe n8n team overhauled this node in n8n 1.64.0. This document reflects the latest version of the node. If you're using an older version of n8n, you can find the previous version of this document [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/7a66308290e6e5b104fcb82a3beafa0d6987df36/docs/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates.md).\n///\n\n## Operation modes\n\nThe remove duplication node works differently depending on the value of the **operation** parameter:\n\n* **[Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input](#remove-items-repeated-within-current-input)**: Identify and remove duplicate items in the current input across all fields or a subset of fields.\n* **[Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions](#remove-items-processed-in-previous-executions)**: Compare items in the current input to items from previous executions and remove duplicates.\n* **[Clear Deduplication History](#clear-deduplication-history)**: Wipe the memory of items from previous executions.\n\n### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input\n\nWhen you set the \"Operations\" field to **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input**, the Remove Duplicate node identifies and removes duplicate items in the current input. It can do this across all fields, or within a subset of fields.\n\n#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input parameters\n\nWhen using the **Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input** operation, the following parameter is available:\n\n* **Compare**: Select which fields of the input data n8n should compare to check if they're the same. The following options are available:\n\t* **All Fields**: Compares all fields of the input data.\n\t* **All Fields Except**: Enter which input data fields n8n should exclude from the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n\t* **Selected Fields**: Enter which input data fields n8n should include in the comparison. You can provide multiple values separated by commas.\n\n#### Remove Items Repeated Within Current Input options\n\nIf you choose **All Fields Except** or **Selected Fields** as your compare type, you can add these options:\n\n* **Disable Dot Notation**: Set whether to use dot notation to reference child fields in the format `parent.child` (turned off) or not (turn on).\n* **Remove Other Fields**: Set whether to remove any fields that aren't used in the comparison (turned on) or not (turned off).\n\n### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions\n\nWhen you set the \"Operation\" field to **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions**, the Remove Duplicate node compares items in the current input to items from previous executions.\n\n#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions parameters\n\nWhen using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following parameters are available:\n\n* **Keep Items Where**: Select how n8n decides which items to keep. The following options are available:\n\t* **Value Is New**: n8n removes items if their value matches items from earlier executions.\n\t* **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**: n8n removes items if the current value isn't higher than previous values.\n\t* **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**: n8n removes date items if the current date isn't later than previous dates.\n\n* **Value to Dedupe On**: The input field or fields to compare. The option you select for the **Keep Items Where** parameter determines the exact format you need:\n\t* When using **Value Is New**, this must be an input field or combination of fields with a unique ID.\n\t* When using **Value Is Higher than Any Previous Value**, this must be an input field or combination of fields that has an incremental value.\n\t* When using **Value Is a Date Later than Any Previous Date**, this must be an input field that has a date value in ISO format.\n\n#### Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions options\n\nWhen using the **Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions** operation, the following option is available:\n\n* **Scope**: Sets how n8n stores and uses the deduplication data for comparisons. The following options are available:\n\t* **Node**: (default) Stores the data for this node independently from other Remove Duplicates instances in the workflow. When you use this scope, you can [clear the duplication history](#clear-deduplication-history) for this node instance without affecting other nodes.\n\t* **Workflow**: Stores the duplication data at the workflow level. This shares duplication data with any other Remove Duplicate nodes set to use \"workflow\" scope.  n8n will still manage the duplication data for other Remove Duplicate nodes set to \"node\" scope independently.\n\nWhen you select **Value Is New** as your **Keep Items Where** choice, this option is also available:\n\n* **History Size**: The number of items for n8n to store to track duplicates across executions. The value of the **Scope** option determines whether this history size is specific to this individual Remove Duplicate node instance or shared with other instances in the workflow. By default, n8n stores 10,000 items.\n\n### Clear Deduplication History\n\nWhen you set the \"Operation\" field to **Clear Deduplication History**, the Remove Duplicates node manages and clears the stored items from previous executions. This operation doesn't affect any items in the current input. Instead, it manages the database of items that the \"Remove Items Processed in Previous Executions\" operation uses.\n\n#### Clear Deduplication History parameters\n\nWhen using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following parameter is available:\n\n* **Mode**: How you want to manage the key / value items stored in the database. The following option is available:\n\t* **Clean Database**: Deletes all duplication data stored in the database. This resets the duplication database to its original state.\n\n#### Clear Deduplication History options\n\nWhen using the **Clear Deduplication History** operation, the following option is available:\n\n* **Scope**: Sets the scope n8n uses when managing the duplication database.\n\t* **Node**: (default) Manages the duplication database specific to this Remove Duplicates node instance.\n\t* **Workflow**: Manages the duplication database shared by all Remove Duplicate node instances that use workflow scope.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\nFor templates using the Remove Duplicates node and examples of how to use it, refer to [Templates and examples](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.removeduplicates/templates-and-examples.md).\n\n## Related resources\n\n--8<-- \"_snippets/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/data-transformation-actions/data-section-link.md\"\n"

Follow technical documentation to integrate Webhook node into your workflows.\npriority: critical\ncontentType: [integration, reference]\ntags:\n  - \"webhook set route parameters\"\n  - \"get webhook URL\"\n  - \"call workflow externally\"\nhide:\n  - tags\n---\n\n# Webhook node\n\nUse the Webhook node to create [webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook), which can receive data from apps and services when an event occurs. It's a trigger node, which means it can start an n8n workflow. This allows services to connect to n8n and run a workflow.\n\nYou can use the Webhook node as a trigger for a workflow when you want to receive data and run a workflow based on the data. The Webhook node also supports returning the data generated at the end of a workflow. This makes it useful for building a workflow to process data and return the results, like an API endpoint.\n\nThe webhook allows you to trigger workflows from services that don't have a dedicated app trigger node.\n\n## Workflow development process\n\nn8n provides different **Webhook URL**s for testing and production. The testing URL includes an option to **Listen for test event**. Refer to [Workflow development](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/workflow-development.md) for more information on building, testing, and shifting your Webhook node to production.\n\n## Node parameters\n\nUse these parameters to configure your node.\n\n### Webhook URLs\n\nThe Webhook node has two **Webhook URLs**: test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.\n\nSelect **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.\n\n<figure markdown=\"span\">\n![Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab display a Test URL and Production URL](/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/webhook/webhook-urls.png)\n<figcaption>Sample Webhook URLs in the Webhook node's Parameters tab</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n* **Test**: n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Execute workflow**, if the workflow isn't active. When you call the webhook URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.\n* **Production**: n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.\n\n### HTTP Method\n\nThe Webhook node supports standard [HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods):\n\n* DELETE\n* GET\n* HEAD\n* PATCH\n* POST\n* PUT\n\n    /// note | Webhook max payload\n\tThe webhook maximum payload size is 16MB.\n  If you're self-hosting n8n, you can change this using the [endpoint environment variable](/hosting/configuration/environment-variables/endpoints.md) `N8N_PAYLOAD_SIZE_MAX`.\n\t///\t\n\n### Path\n\nBy default, this field contains a randomly generated webhook URL path, to avoid conflicts with other webhook nodes. \n\nYou can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.\n\nThe **Path** field can take the following formats:\n\n- `/:variable`\n- `/path/:variable`\n- `/:variable/path`\n- `/:variable1/path/:variable2`\n- `/:variable1/:variable2`\n\n### Supported authentication methods\n\nYou can require authentication for any service calling your webhook URL. Choose from these authentication methods:\n\n- Basic auth\n- Header auth\n- JWT auth\n- None\n\nRefer to [Webhook credentials](/integrations/builtin/credentials/webhook.md) for more information on setting up each credential type.\n\n### Respond\n\n* **Immediately**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the message **Workflow got started**.\n* **When Last Node Finishes**: The Webhook node returns the response code and the data output from the last node executed in the workflow.\n* **Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node**: The Webhook node responds as defined in the [Respond to Webhook](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.respondtowebhook.md) node.\n* **Streaming response**: Enables real-time data streaming back to the user as the workflow processes. Requires nodes with streaming support in the workflow (for example, the [AI agent](/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/index.md) node).\n\n### Response Code\n\nCustomize the [HTTP response code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) that the Webhook node returns upon successful execution. Select from common response codes or create a custom code.\n\n### Response Data\n\nChoose what data to include in the response body:\n\n* **All Entries**: The Webhook returns all the entries of the last node in an array.\n* **First Entry JSON**: The Webhook returns the JSON data of the first entry of the last node in a JSON object.\n* **First Entry Binary**: The Webhook returns the binary data of the first entry of the last node in a binary file.\n* **No Response Body**: The Webhook returns without a body.\n\nApplies only to **Respond > When Last Node Finishes**.\n\n## Node options\n\nSelect **Add Option** to view more configuration options. The available options depend on your node parameters. Refer to the table for option availability.\n\n* **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set the permitted cross-origin domains. Enter a comma-separated list of URLs allowed for cross-origin non-preflight requests. Use `*` (default) to allow all origins.\n* **Binary Property**: Enabling this setting allows the Webhook node to receive binary data, such as an image or audio file. Enter the name of the binary property to write the data of the received file to.\n* **Ignore Bots**: Ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers.\n* **IP(s) Whitelist**: Enable this to limit who (or what) can invoke a Webhook trigger URL. Enter a comma-separated list of allowed IP addresses. Access from IP addresses outside the whitelist throws a 403 error. If left blank, all IP addresses can invoke the webhook trigger URL.\n* **No Response Body**: Enable this to prevent n8n sending a body with the response.\n* **Raw Body**: Specify that the Webhook node will receive data in a raw format, such as JSON or XML.\n* **Response Content-Type**: Choose the format for the webhook body.\n* **Response Data**: Send custom data with the response.\n* **Response Headers**: Send extra headers in the Webhook response. Refer to [MDN Web Docs | Response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) to learn more about response headers.\n* **Property Name**: by default, n8n returns all available data. You can choose to return a specific JSON key, so that n8n returns the value.\n\n| Option | Required node configuration |\n| ------ | --------------------------- | \n| Allowed Origins (CORS) | Any |\n| Binary Property | Either: <br />HTTP Method > POST <br /> HTTP Method > PATCH <br /> HTTP Method > PUT |\n| Ignore Bots | Any |\n| IP(s) Whitelist | Any |\n| Property Name | Both: <br /> Respond > When Last Node Finishes <br /> Response Data > First Entry JSON |\n| No Response Body | Respond > Immediately |\n| Raw Body | Any |\n| Response Code | Any except Respond > Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node |\n| Response Content-Type | Both: <br /> Respond > When Last Node Finishes <br /> Response Data > First Entry JSON |\n| Response Data | Respond > Immediately |\n| Response Headers | Any |\n\n## How n8n secures HTML responses\n\nStarting with [n8n version 1.103.0](/release-notes.md#n8n11030), n8n automatically wraps HTML responses to webhooks in `<iframe>` tags. This is a security mechanism to protect the instance users.\n\nThis has the following implications:\n\n- HTML renders in a sandboxed iframe instead of directly in the parent document.\n- JavaScript code that attempts to access the top-level window or local storage will fail.\n- Authentication headers aren't available in the sandboxed iframe (for example, basic auth). You need to use an alternative approach, like embedding a short-lived access token within the HTML.\n- Relative URLs (for example, `<form action=\"/\">`) won't work. Use absolute URLs instead.\n\n## Templates and examples\n\n<!-- see https://www.notion.so/n8n/Pull-in-templates-for-the-integrations-pages-37c716837b804d30a33b47475f6e3780 -->\n[[ templatesWidget(page.title, 'webhook') ]]\n\n## Common issues\n\nFor common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to [Common issues](/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.webhook/common-issues.md).\n"
